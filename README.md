### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an engineering student in my last year (M2) at [ENSEEIHT](https://www.enseeiht.fr) in Digital Sciences.<br />
I am the developer of WaggaSim, one of the most realistic and innovative paragliding simulators.

My most ambitious project so far: Developping the most realistic paraglider simulator possible.<br />
The wings have realistic aerodynamics and soft-body physics.<br />
It is also possible to design custom wing to see how they fly and react.<br /><br />
Available on steam ! [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3058640/WaggaSim/?l=french)<br /><br />
The trailer of the of the sim can be found [here](https://youtu.be/IcreMfQV42Y)<br />
<br />
* **Other projects**<br />
- C# 2d fluid simulation<br />
- C# & C++ 3D Physics simulations: Xpbd, verlet integration, simulating rigidbodies and softbodies such as fabric<br />
- Augmented reality projects: C++ and C# (C# used in unity with the Hololens)
- Computer vision
- 3D reconstruction
- 3D compression and streaming
- JS Verlet integration
- OpenVario: Open source vario for paraglider and glider pilots.
